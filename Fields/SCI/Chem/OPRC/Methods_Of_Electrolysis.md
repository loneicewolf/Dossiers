## Scenario 1 - H,C,L
- H² + Cl²  >  HCL (hydrochloric acid) (which could come from electrolysis of NaCl(salt(SodiumChlorid) and water(H2o)) since that releases H hydrogen and Cl chlorine, which, if come into contact with water (inevitable) it forms HCL,)

## Scenario 2 - Na,F,F2
- Same with a solution(aquas solution, water for example) with NaF (sodium Fluoride) if you perform electrolysis on this solution, you get H hydrogen and F fluorine, which, if come into contact with water (inevitable) it forms HF(hydrogen fluoride, aka? HydrogenFluroricacid(..))

## Scenario 3 (not about water but about Posphorus compounds) PCl {3,5}
Red phosphorus and Chlorine, would make phosphorus penta/tri chloride, depending on the circumstances

- Penta: IFF cl2 is in excess.
- Tri: IFF cl2 is not so much.

P+Cl₂=PCl₃(tri), or PCl₅(penta)
