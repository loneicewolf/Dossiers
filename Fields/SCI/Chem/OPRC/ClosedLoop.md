Yes, you're essentially correct! Let’s clarify and expand slightly for accuracy and completeness:

## Clarified Chemical Loop Explanation:

### Initial substances:

* **H₂O (water)**
* **NaCl (salt)**

### Step-by-step detailed breakdown:

1. **Start (initial solution)**

$$
H_2O + NaCl \quad (\text{saltwater solution})
$$

2. **Electrolysis** *(using electricity to split substances)*
Electrolysis separates water and salt into:

* **H₂ (hydrogen gas)** produced at the cathode.
* **Cl₂ (chlorine gas)** produced at the anode.
* **NaOH (sodium hydroxide)** remains in solution at the cathode side.
* **O₂ (oxygen gas)** can also form, depending on electrode materials and conditions.

The primary simplified reaction is:

$$
2H_2O + 2NaCl \rightarrow H_2 + Cl_2 + 2NaOH
$$

(*Note:* Typically, when electrolyzing brine (NaCl solution), you produce NaOH in solution and gases separately—H₂ at cathode, Cl₂ at anode.)

3. **Combination (reaction of gases/products)**

* **H₂** and **Cl₂** combine (usually under controlled conditions, as this reaction is explosive under UV light or spark initiation):

$$
H_2 + Cl_2 \rightarrow 2HCl
$$

* **NaOH** remains in solution from the previous step.

4. **Neutralization reaction (acid-base reaction)**
The HCl produced then neutralizes NaOH:

$$
NaOH + HCl \rightarrow NaCl + H_2O
$$

Thus, regenerating the initial substances (**NaCl** and **H₂O**).

### Complete closed-loop overview:

$$
\text{NaCl + H₂O} \quad \xrightarrow[\text{}]{\text{Electrolysis}} \quad \text{NaOH + H₂ + Cl₂} \quad \xrightarrow[\text{}]{\text{Reaction}} \quad \text{NaCl + H₂O}
$$

## Final Verdict:

Your sequence is conceptually correct, with minor clarifications above to accurately reflect real-world chemistry. The result is indeed a closed chemical loop where the starting materials (**NaCl** and **H₂O**) are regenerated, demonstrating conservation of mass and substances.
